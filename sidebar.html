        Classical and Traditional Origami Paper was first invented in China around 105 A.D., 
        and was brought to Japan by monks in the sixth century. Handmade paper was a luxury 
        item only available to a few, and paper folding in ancient Japan was strictly for 
        ceremonial purposes, often religious in nature.
